INSTALLATION

To flash it, flash at least zImage and factoryfs.ext4 using Heimdall http://www.glassechidna.com.au/products/heimdall/
setup_fs should automatically reformat data,dbdata and cache to ext4 on first boot.
If not please reboot to recovery and try wipe from recovery.

3G Data: OK
Wifi: OK
BT: OK
GPS: working
Lights: OK
Sensors: OK
Camera: mostly OK (video recording broken)

Issues and workarounds
* Stuck on CM boot ani after flash
    After first install please start in recovery and do full wipe (select "wipe data/factory reset in recovery)

* BT doesnt start
    Try again
    Try rebooting
    If that doesnt help try "adb shell stop hciattach" Sometimes hciattach service gets stuck when starting.

    Add attribute for available frequencies, fix cpufreq sysfs permissions so CMParts can access it.
    Change compile options for kernel to cortex-a8. Enable Tiny RCU.
    Fixed calls from other places in the kernel that used olde speed levels and caused frequency spikes to 1.2GHz.

    Switched to Gingerbread kernel 2.6.35.7 recently released by Samsung.
    Use JQ1 binary drivers for OpenGL, sensors, lights, copybit, overylay, camera etc, so they all work!
    Portrait is default orientation now, ro.sf.hwrotation=90 is set and touchscreen events are rotated in input layer so they match.

2011-04-21
    Fix mounting Tab as USB drive (ums switch in kernel reported "ums online" instead of "online" that vold expects)
    Fixed phone calls. Reapply RIL.java and RILConstants.java patches from cmsgs frameworks_base.

    Cleanup of init scripts, added /sdcard and /emmc links.

    Refreshed, merged and rebuilt, media scanner works again
2011-03-01
    Refreshed and merged latest frameworks etc from CM repo
    Rebuilt everything
    Use vold built from source

2011-02-17
    Refreshed repo and rebuild
    initramfs built from sources instead of checked in, still far from automated build tho ;-(
2011-02-07
    Refreshed repo and rebuilt.
    Backed out codeworkx's bluetooth fix, it seems to make things worse. Added stopping and cleaning up hciattach if it fails. Now if Bluetooth start fails, just try starting it again.
    Removed overlay and copybit built from source, they cant both be installed. Use binary copybit since the ones built from the source use wrong kernel headers. Camera shows some signs of life now.
    Patched code that calls gralloc to remove usage flags not known by froyo gralloc.
    
2011-02-03 New kernel from Update1
    Refreshed repo and rebuild with latest
    added codeworkx's brcm_patchram_plus fix that should hopefully fix bluetooth initialization
